		<p>If you want to be able to go out and enjoy the ride you will need to have the proper equipment to maintain and prep the bike, as well as, be prepared to handle any minor emergency or malfunction that you may face.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Bike! Well, duh! Whether you just want an entry level or an "I'm going to be hardcore" beast.</li>
				<li>Helmet. You will <strong>NEED</strong> a brain bucket. Hopefully, you will never have be in a situation where you'll need it, but realistically, you will. Better be safe than sorry!</li>
				<li>Bike pump. You will need to keep those tires properly inflated.</li>
				<li>Chain lube. You have to keep that chain protected from the harsh elements it will be facing: water, dust, dirt, salt from winter roads, and so much other crap!</li>
				<li>Patch kit and extra inner tubes or sealant. Getting a flat sucks when your 10 miles away from the car. Do you really want to walk all the way back? I didn't think so.</li>
			</ul>
